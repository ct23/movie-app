# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# actor = Actor.new({first_name: "Benedict", last_name: "Cumberbatch", known_for: "Sherlock"})
# actor.save

# Movie.create(title: "Avengers: Endgame", year:2019, plot:"Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle.
